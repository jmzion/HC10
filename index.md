'''For HC3, my partner and I analyzed the rankings from multiple websites for our neighborhoods. Williamsburg is one of the best places to live in New York City, according to Niche and other rankings. The neighborhood is good for young professionals and families due to its above average public education and the dense urban feel. Although it is not considered the safest, it has many restaurants, shops, and parks for the community. Williamsburg was rated A+ for its nightlife and is very close to the city, making it a hotspot for travelers.
