## Williamsburg

The neighborhood that I worked on for CSCI 127 is **Williamsburg** in Brooklyn, NY. 
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jmzion/HC8/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
